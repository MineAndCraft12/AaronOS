    - You
This agreement pertains to:
    - AaronOS ("Project", "aOS")
    - AaronOS's Code
    - AaronOS's Resources (including images, sound files, etc) (not including placeholder resources which Aaron did not create or pay for)

By deploying or otherwise using the AaronOS project's code and resources, you are agreeing to the agreement laid out in this document.


The EULA (this document) may be updated at any time, which will be reflected when the project is updated.
When downloading a GitHub update of AaronOS to your server, this updated file will be carried in that update. Aaron will also attempt to notify
    deployers of this change, should it occur.


LIABILITY

While it is highly unlikely that it should occur, you agree that Aaron is not responsible for any damage caused by this software and its resources,
    whether direct or indirect. You agree that Aaron holds no liability should this occur, and will not pursue legal or non-legal action against him or the project.


INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

All code, designs, and resources (excluding those owned by others, such as placeholder resources listed near the beginning of the document) are owned by Aaron, and
    you agree not to claim them to be your own.

The AaronOS logos and other text- or image-based branding are not to modified in such a way that makes it difficult for users to understand that the project is, in fact, AaronOS.
Examples of acceptable logo or branding modification include but are not limited to:
    - modifying the visual style to portray a unique theme
    - utilizing the backdrop design of the AaronOS icons to create your own unique icons, without changing the meaning of existing icons
    - creating an identity for your own changes to AaronOS that does not appear to change the identity of the project as a whole
        - an example includes creating a unique logo and name for your own changes, while including a clearly visible message pointing back to AaronOS as the original work
        - one real-world acceptable example is a third-party developer who changed the primary name and logo, but left "Powered by AaronOS" clearly visible alongside their modified name and logo
Examples of unacceptable logo or branding modification include but are not limited to:
    - modifications that make it difficult for users to understand that AaronOS is the original work
        - an example includes changing or removing content that is important to identifying the original work, without including a clearly visible message pointing back to AaronOS as the original work
    - modifications that appear to change the identity of AaronOS, or appear to change the identity of existing AaronOS content
        - an example includes rebranding AaronOS as a whole without including a clearly visible message pointing back to AaronOS as the original work
        - an additional example includes rebranding AaronOS content such as NORAA or AaronOS Blast under a different name
    - modifications that appear to convey ownership of AaronOS to anyone other than Aaron Adams, the original creator of AaronOS
        - an example includes changing the name, logo, or content of AaronOS in such a way to convey that the original work was not made by Aaron Adams
